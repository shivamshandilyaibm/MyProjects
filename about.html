<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a results-driven technology professional with a strong foundation in both business and technical domains. Holding a BTech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from KIIT, Bhubaneshwar, and an MBA from SBM, NMIMS Mumbai, I’ve developed a keen understanding of how to align technology with strategic business goals.
In my current role as a Technology Sales Specialist at IBM, I leverage my expertise to help clients navigate their digital transformation journeys. My work involves crafting tailored solutions that address complex business challenges, ensuring that technology investments deliver maximum value. During my time at IBM, I've not only honed my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of market dynamics and client needs.
My commitment to continuous learning is reflected in the certifications I’ve earned. The Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) provided me with a broad understanding of cloud services and Azure's key features, while the Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator (AZ-104) has equipped me with the skills needed to manage Azure resources and optimize cloud performance. Additionally, my certifications in IBM MQ and Apptio Cloudability highlight my ability to work with enterprise-grade tools and cloud cost management solutions.
I am also pursuing advanced certifications in areas like cloud security and AI, which will further enhance my ability to drive innovation and lead projects that require cutting-edge expertise.

<p>My MBA from NMIMS has been instrumental in refining my business acumen, enabling me to think strategically about how technology can be used to solve business problems. This blend of technical and business knowledge makes me well-suited for roles that require both deep technical understanding and strategic foresight.
I’m passionate about leveraging technology to create meaningful impact and am now looking to expand my horizons into product management. I believe that successful products are built at the intersection of customer needs, market trends, and technological innovation.
Outside of work, I’m committed to lifelong learning and actively seek out opportunities to grow, whether through professional certifications, attending industry events, or networking with peers. I’m also a strong advocate for a positive and inclusive work culture, having been recognized for my contributions to team morale and engagement.
